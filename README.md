# An In Depth Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

*We are going in depth with Lousie campaigns how each play progressed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals . We should be able to tell the differences how each play developed by analyzing and visualizing charts and graphs. The sol puprpose why we are viewing lauch dates is to determine the most successful theater plays in each month in comparison to unsuccessful and canceled plays. Furthermore funding for these plays is also a key factor due to what budget was each play able to use in every month . This gives us an insight what lousie budget could be for next time .* 


## **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**
 
 - Based on my research **May** through **August** was the most successful months out of the year for **plays** to be **launched in theaters**. With a total of (*three-hundred and thirteen*) **plays** being successful in those fours months out of (*six-hundred and ninety four*). To add on in those four months , **theaters** where also the most succesful but in each month half of the **theaters failed**. However, very few **canceled** in despite of the theaters outcomes.

## **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**
- Based on my analysis the **total of projects** successful rate for **Goals** (*less than a thousand*) was (*sevnty-six percent*) which had a total of (*one hundred eighty-six*) projects and **Goals** between a ( *one thousand to five thousand*) had a (*sevnty-three*) percent which had (*five hundred and thirty-four*) **projects**. Translating into more then (*seventy*) percent met the **funding goal** for the **total of projects** . Another key factor when visually looking at the line chart after the **funding goals** goes above (*five thousand*) the **failed** percenatge rate start to drastically to escalate. My recommendations for **funding goals** should be (*less than five thousand*) because anything over that you wont see good results .

## **Summary**
 - In conclusion based on the **Outcomes based on Launch Date** ***October and December*** was the worst months for **plays** to be **launched in theaters** because of the fact they had just as much **succesful outcomes as failed**. However **October** was the only month to have **(zero) canceled**. Overall **May** has the most **successful outcome**. In addition based on **Outcomes based on Goals** i can conclude more than half of the **goals** was unsuccessful between (*fifteen thousand and thity-five thousand*). I would recommend making the **goal** to (*less then a thousand*) due to being the highest success rate .

## **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**
  - Some challenges i experienced were using the "**=COUNTIFS()**" formula i was stuck for about an hour. I couldn't get the right numbers plugged in or the formula wouldn't function. I solved this by going back through the sections and looking back through my notes . Another problem i encoutered was getting "**Outcomes based on Goals**" line chart to function on top of that my line chart was off due to missing numbers. I ended up double checking my numbers i found out there was a row missing i ended up pluggin in that row to get my percentages right and my line chart working.

## **Limitations and Graph Suggestions**
   - Some limitations this dataset has is not being able to see what specific days where **unsuccessful** compared to **successful** or going more in depth what times were the most successful **theaters** so they can release plays. Another limitation is not seeing what regions and citys had the less or more **successful plays**. Possible graphs that we could've used for "**Outcomes based on Goals**" are pie charts or clustered columns . The pie chart could be of better use just to get better visualiztion of the percenatges.
